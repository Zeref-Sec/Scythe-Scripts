# Scyth3 Scripts

## WORK IN PROGRESS

**Scyth3 Scripts** is an emerging web-based platform designed to streamline the workflow of penetration testers. It integrates various security tools into a unified interface, enabling users to manage reconnaissance, project details, and vulnerability scanning from a single browser-based application.

## Key Features

- **Active Recon Modules**: Execute active reconnaissance tasks such as port scanning and service detection with ease.
- **Passive Recon Modules**: Perform stealthy information gathering to enhance your assessments without direct interaction.
- **Project Management**: Organize and track multiple projects, manage scan results, and maintain detailed records.
- **Results Page**: View and analyze scan results with interactive tables and comprehensive breakdowns.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Conduct vulnerability assessments using tools like WPScan and Nuclei, and manage findings within the platform.
